1. Integration on Azure DevOps for easier management ( waiting on Selman Hoca )
Status: Waiting.
2. Refactor code in a way that you don't constantly add new RowStyles in LogIn Screen ( takes memory to create them )
Status: On hold.
3. Refactor code in a way that you can change between Starting Screen and Login Screen without passing MainWindow as parent to them ( not good practice, to solve probably need to use interfaces )
Status: Done.
4. Decide on the design of the menu after login. 
Status: Done.
5. Implement the said design.
Status: Done.
6. Instead of MessageBoxes use something else to show messages to user.
Status: Waiting.
7. Add a logging system.
Status: Waiting.
8. Add a remember me checkbox, with it a config file ( ? - must ask if needed ).
Status: Waiting.
9. Make screens layout more dynamic.
Status: Done.
10. Fix documentation.
Status: Waiting.
11. Add Manage Connection Screen. 
Status: Done.
12. Separate Input Form from login screen for reusability.
Status: Done.
13. Refactor Code so that it uses MVC architecture.
Status: Done.
14. Implement Insert Connection function.
Status: Done.
15. Implement Update Connection function.
Status: Done.
16. Implement Delete Connection function.
Status: Done.
17. Implement Show Procedures List screen.
Status: Done.
18. Implement Execute Procedures screen.
Status: Done.
19. Add Password Encryption ( + app.config file, normally it shouldn't get uploaded to GitHub since it contains the encryption key but this is a test environment ).
Status: Done.
20. Add Establish Connection Button at Manage Connections.
Status: Canceled. Reason - connection is established once when a SP gets executed to a server's database and it remains open for the rest of that session. Note: should discuss if a Establish Connection & Disconnect Option is needed.
