1. Integration on Azure DevOps for easier management ( waiting on Selman Hoca )
2. Refactor code in a way that you don't constantly add new RowStyles in LogIn Screen ( takes memory to create them )
3. Refactor code in a way that you can change between Starting Screen and Login Screen without passing MainWindow as parent to them ( not good practice, to solve probably need to use interfaces )
4. Decide on the design of the menu after login ( waiting on Emre abi ). 
5. Implement the said design.
6. Instead of MessageBox'es use something else to show messages to user.
7. Add a logging system.
8. Add a remember me checkbox, with it a config file ( ? - must ask if needed ).
9. Make screens layout more dynamic.
10. Fix documentation.

My To Do List order: 3 ( probably today ), 2.
