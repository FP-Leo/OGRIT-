### OGRIT Database Custom App:

- User Authentication: Log in to your main database.
- Connection Management: Store remote database connection details in one database.
- Procedure Listing: Display and manage lists of stored procedures.
- Stored Procedures Execution: Execute stored procedures directly from the interface to the selected remote databases.


Common Features:

1. User Authentication: Implement a login system to allow users to login to their main database. The login system can validate credentials using different authentication methods such as Windows Authentication or SQL Server Authentication.

2. Connection Management: Connection details of remote databases are stored in the main database. Users can add, update, or delete database connection strings. 

3. Procedure Listing: Offer a screen that lists all available stored procedures within a selected database. Users can view details about each procedure before choosing which one to execute.

4. Stored Procedures Execution: Enable users to select and execute stored procedures from the interface. The application should allow users to choose multiple connection, select multiple stored procedure, and execute them to each chosen connection, displaying any results returned by the procedures.


5. Menu Navigation: Include a centralized menu for navigating between different screens such as managing connections, viewing stored procedures, executing procedures, and logging out of the application.

6. Responsive UI Design: Ensure that the application's user interface is responsive to different screen sizes. Elements like buttons, forms, and tables should adjust to the size of the window, maintaining usability across various display settings.

7. Data Grid Management: Provide a data grid view for displaying detailed information related to database connections and stored procedures. Users should be able to sort, filter, and interact with the data presented in these grids.

8. Service Reminders: Although not directly relevant to a database management app, the concept of reminders can be applied to notifying users of important events such as upcoming maintenance for database connections or reminders for executing regular procedures.
