### OGRIT Database Custom App:

- Connection Management: Manage and maintain different database connections.
- Stored Procedures Execution: Execute stored procedures directly from the interface.
- Procedure Listing: Display and manage lists of stored procedures.
- User Authentication: Facilitate user login and access control within the application.

Common Features:

1. User Authentication: Implement a login system to allow users to securely access the application. The login system can validate credentials using different authentication methods such as Windows Authentication or SQL Server Authentication.

2. Connection Management: Provide tools for managing database connections. Users can add, update, or delete database connection strings. Each connection can store details such as server IP, instance name, and authentication type.

3. Stored Procedures Execution: Enable users to select and execute stored procedures from the interface. The application should allow users to choose a connection, select a stored procedure, and execute it, displaying any results returned by the procedure.

4. Procedure Listing: Offer a screen that lists all available stored procedures within a selected database. Users can view details about each procedure and organize them based on different criteria.

5. Menu Navigation: Include a centralized menu for navigating between different screens such as managing connections, viewing stored procedures, executing procedures, and logging out of the application.

6. Responsive UI Design: Ensure that the application's user interface is responsive to different screen sizes. Elements like buttons, forms, and tables should adjust to the size of the window, maintaining usability across various display settings.

7. Data Grid Management: Provide a data grid view for displaying detailed information related to database connections and stored procedures. Users should be able to sort, filter, and interact with the data presented in these grids.

8. Service Reminders: Although not directly relevant to a database management app, the concept of reminders can be applied to notifying users of important events such as upcoming maintenance for database connections or reminders for executing regular procedures.
